#Why take this course?
In this course you will learn how to
- Create your own iOS app from scratch
- Learn Objective-C from a Java perspective
- Deploy your apps onto the Apple App Store&trade; or Juan Diego's iPads
- Use industry standard source code management techniques using [github](www.github.com)

#Emphasis - Spring 2013
This semester students will be implementing an iPhone and iPad app for
Juan Diego's day planner. Quarter 3 will be spent learning Objective-C and
implementing a single-user application in iOS 5. The first half of quarter 4
will then be spent implementing new features of iOS 6 and turning your apps into
multi-user homework and day planners which will sync with iCloud and/or Google.
